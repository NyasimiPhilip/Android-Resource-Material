<h1>Title: Stopwatch Service Demo</h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>The Stopwatch Service Demo is an Android application showcasing the implementation of a background service to create a stopwatch functionality. It allows users to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch, with real-time updates displayed on the user interface.</p>

<h2>Feature Components:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MainActivity:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The main activity of the application.</li>
      <li>Utilizes View Binding to set up the user interface.</li>
      <li>Provides buttons to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.</li>
      <li>Communicates with the Stopwatch service via intents.</li>
      <li>Receives updates from the service and updates the UI accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>StopWatchService:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Extends the Service class to create a background service for the stopwatch functionality.</li>
      <li>Initializes a timer for scheduling tasks.</li>
      <li>Implements onStartCommand to handle service start behavior and schedule stopwatch updates.</li>
      <li>Implements onDestroy to perform cleanup tasks when the service is destroyed.</li>
      <li>Defines a companion object holding constant values for intent extras and logging.</li>
      <li>Contains an inner class representing the task to be scheduled by the timer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Flow:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The user interacts with the MainActivity by clicking the start, stop, or reset buttons.</li>
  <li>Upon clicking the buttons, corresponding intents are created to start, stop, or reset the stopwatch service.</li>
  <li>The StopwatchService receives the intents and performs the respective actions, such as starting or stopping the timer.</li>
  <li>The service schedules a task to update the stopwatch time at fixed intervals.</li>
  <li>The task sends broadcast intents with updated time values.</li>
  <li>MainActivity receives the broadcast intents, extracts the time values, and updates the UI with the formatted time.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Background Service:</strong> Utilized to perform long-running tasks, such as stopwatch functionality, independently of the main UI thread.</li>
  <li><strong>Intent Communication:</strong> Facilitates communication between components by passing data and triggering actions.</li>
  <li><strong>Timer Task:</strong> Scheduled to execute periodically to update the stopwatch time.</li>
  <li><strong>Broadcast Receiver:</strong> Listens for broadcast intents sent by the service to receive updated time values.</li>
  <li><strong>View Binding:</strong> Efficient way to interact with views in the layout, enhancing code readability and maintainability.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Stopwatch Service Demo provides a practical example of implementing a background service for a stopwatch feature in Android apps. It demonstrates the seamless coordination between the main activity and the background service to provide a smooth user experience.</p>
