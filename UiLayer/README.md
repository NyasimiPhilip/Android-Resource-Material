<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>The Counter App is a simple Android application designed to demonstrate the implementation of a counter feature using Jetpack Compose for the user interface (UI) and ViewModel for managing UI-related data and logic. The app allows users to enter a numerical value, add it to a running total, and reset the total when needed. It showcases modern Android development practices and patterns, providing a practical example for developers learning Compose and ViewModel architecture.</p>

<h2>Feature Components:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MainActivity:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The main activity responsible for displaying the user interface.</li>
      <li>Utilizes Jetpack Compose to define the UI components.</li>
      <li>Communicates with the CounterViewModel to handle user interactions and update UI state.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CounterViewModel:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Manages the UI-related data and logic for the counter feature.</li>
      <li>Exposes the current state of the counter to the MainActivity.</li>
      <li>Responds to user events, such as entering a value, clicking the count button, and resetting the counter.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>CounterEvent:</strong> A sealed class representing different user events that can occur in the app, such as entering a value, counting, or resetting.</li>
  <li><strong>MainScreenState:</strong> A data class representing the current state of the main screen, including the visibility of the count button, the displayed result, and the input value.</li>
  <li><strong>UIEvent:</strong> A sealed class representing UI-related events, such as showing a message to the user.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Flow:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>User interacts with the MainActivity by entering a numerical value and clicking buttons to count or reset.</li>
  <li>MainActivity communicates with the CounterViewModel by triggering events based on user interactions.</li>
  <li>CounterViewModel updates the MainScreenState based on the received events and emits UI events, if necessary.</li>
  <li>MainActivity observes changes in the MainScreenState and updates the UI accordingly to reflect the current state.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jetpack Compose:</strong> Utilized for building the user interface in a declarative and composable manner, enhancing UI development productivity and code readability.</li>
  <li><strong>ViewModel Architecture:</strong> Followed to separate UI-related data and logic from the UI components, promoting better separation of concerns and easier testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Sealed Classes:</strong> Used to represent finite sets of states and events, providing type safety and enabling exhaustive handling of all possible cases.</li>
  <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Implemented using mutable state objects and state flow to manage and propagate changes in UI state throughout the app.</li>
  <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Employed to capture and respond to user interactions, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>UI Feedback:</strong> Incorporated UI events and state updates to provide feedback to the user, such as displaying messages or updating UI elements dynamically.</li>
</ul>
