## MainActivity.kt

### Data Binding:

The activity layout `activity_main.xml` is bound to the MainActivity using Data Binding. This is done with the `DataBindingUtil.setContentView` method, which sets the content view for the activity and returns a binding object (`ActivityMainBinding`).

### ViewModel Integration:

An instance of `MainViewModel` is created and set as the view model for the data binding. This allows the layout to directly access properties and methods of the view model.

### Button Click Listener:

A click listener is set for the `controlButton` in the layout. When the button is clicked, it invokes the `onButtonClicked` method in the view model.

## MainViewModel.kt

### ViewModel Implementation:

The `MainViewModel` class extends `ViewModel` and serves as the logic handler for the UI.

### ObservableFields:

Two `ObservableField` variables are used to track the visibility of a progress bar (`progressBarVisibility`) and the text displayed on a button (`buttonText`). These fields are observable, meaning any changes to their values will automatically update the UI.

### Button Click Handling:

The `onButtonClicked` method toggles the visibility of the progress bar and changes the button text based on its current state.

## Data Binding

### Efficient UI Updates:

Data binding eliminates the need for manual view updates by synchronizing UI components with the underlying data automatically. This leads to cleaner and more efficient code.

## Summary

The code demonstrates how to use Data Binding with a ViewModel to create a responsive UI in an Android application. The ViewModel contains the logic for handling UI interactions, while Data Binding ensures seamless communication between the layout and the ViewModel. This approach promotes separation of concerns and improves code maintainability
