<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>The NotificationDemo app showcases the implementation of notifications in Android applications. It allows users to create and display notifications with various features, including actions and remote input.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Displaying a notification:</strong> Includes a title, content, and icon.</li>
  <li><strong>Adding actions:</strong> Enables user interaction with notifications.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementing remote input:</strong> Allows replying to notifications directly.</li>
  <li><strong>Creating notification channels:</strong> Necessary for Android Oreo (API level 26) and above.</li>
  <li><strong>Handling notification replies:</strong> Capturing and displaying replies in the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Components:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MainActivity:</strong> Responsible for creating and displaying notifications. Manages notification channels and displays notifications with actions and remote input.</li>
  <li><strong>SecondActivity:</strong> Receives user input from notifications and displays it in the app. Triggered when the user replies to a notification.</li>
  <li><strong>DetailsActivity:</strong> Displays additional details, launched from a notification.</li>
  <li><strong>SettingsActivity:</strong> Provides access to app settings, launched from a notification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Flow:</h2>
<p><strong>MainActivity:</strong> Triggers the creation and display of notifications when the user interacts with the app. Notifications contain actions like reply, details, and settings, leading to different activities when clicked. User input from notifications is received in SecondActivity using RemoteInput and displayed in the app.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Notification channels:</strong> Used to categorize notifications and define their behavior, introduced in Android Oreo.</li>
  <li><strong>Remote input:</strong> Allows users to input text directly from notifications without opening the app.</li>
  <li><strong>PendingIntent:</strong> Represents an action to be performed in the future, typically when a notification is clicked.</li>
  <li><strong>NotificationManager:</strong> Manages all notifications in the app, including creating, updating, and canceling them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that the app targets Android Oreo (API level 26) or higher to utilize notification channels effectively and provide a better user experience. Additionally, handle notification permissions gracefully to avoid disruption in notification delivery.</p>
