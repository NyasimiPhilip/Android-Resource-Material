## MainActivity.kt

### Data Binding Initialization:

In the `onCreate` method, the layout file `activity_main.xml` is inflated using `DataBindingUtil.setContentView`. This returns a binding object (`ActivityMainBinding`), which is used to access views in the layout.

### Binding Data:

The `getStudent()` function creates a `Student` object with sample data, and this object is bound to the layout using the `binding.student` property.

## Student.kt

### Data Class Definition:

The `Student` data class defines the structure of a student object, including properties for id, name, and email.

## activity_main.xml (Layout File)

### Data Binding Setup:

The `<layout>` tag wraps the entire layout file, enabling data binding for the XML.

### Variable Declaration:

Inside the `<data>` tag, a variable named `student` of type `Student` is declared. This variable will hold the data to be bound to the layout.

### TextView Bindings:

The `android:text` attributes of the `name_text` and `email_text` TextViews are set to `@{student.name}` and `@{student.email}` respectively. This syntax indicates that the text displayed in these TextViews will be bound to the name and email properties of the student object.

## Summary

This code showcases the power of Data Binding in Android, allowing for seamless integration of data between Kotlin code and XML layouts. By binding data directly to XML views, it simplifies UI development and promotes a more maintainable and readable codebase.
